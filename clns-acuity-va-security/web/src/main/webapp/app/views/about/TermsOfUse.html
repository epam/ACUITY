    <p class="mt">Information taken direct from ACUITY can not be used within regulatory submissions or as input to regulatory reports,
        such as those provided to Ethics Committees and Regulatory Authorities. ACUITY is a very powerful tool for visualising real-time clinical data.
        It is ESSENTIAL that you read and understand the Best Practice guidance for usage of ACUITY before you use it.
        This can be found
        <a target="_blank" href="helpData/ACUITY best practice.pptx">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mt">Your usage of ACUITY is taken as confirmation that you have read and understood the Best Practice guidance
        and accept and agree to abide by the Best Practice guidelines to minimise the risk of unblinding and/or bias.  
        Your Safety Management Team (SaMT) is responsible for considering all available safety information and to develop and maintain the 
        overall safety strategy.  The SaMT leader should be the primary contact for all safety questions.
        Further training on the use of ACUITY is also available from the Help pages
