        ACUITY is a digital solution to revolutionise the way we can interpret and analyse data from
        clinical trials. Whether you're accessing data during an ongoing study or performing analyses at the end
        of a study. It will facilitate data interpretation through an interactive visual platform designed to
        effortlessly enable access across a drug program and individual studies, down to individual patient
        level data. ACUITY aids communication and collaboration within teams, to improve understanding and
        productivity.

        ACUITY is a web application that enables you to view and interact with clinical data as it emerges from
        an ongoing clinical study. This raw data is uncleaned and unvalidated. Data is read into the ACUITY
        database, which in turn populates the graphs and tables that you see in ACUITY.
