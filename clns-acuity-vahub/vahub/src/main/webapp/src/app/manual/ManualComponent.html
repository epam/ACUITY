                    <p>This training provides a basic introduction to the ACUITY system. This guide will walk you through
                        some of the main features and functionality in ACUITY, this is not exhaustive and there is always
                        more than one way to do something in the system. There are also some example questions that
                        exploit some of the key ACUITY functionality and views. If the answer to your question is not
                        here then please use the question box at the top of the page to see if that can help. </p>
                    <p>On many of the points in this page the <img src="/assets/images/task.png"> icon is
                        an activity to try in ACUITY. This is to help familiarise yourself with the ACUITY tool.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4 id="study" class="anchor">STUDY SELECTION PAGE</h4>
                    <p>This page is accessed through the 'Analysis' link in ACUITY and provides access to studies in
                        ACUITY. You will only see the studies you have access to here. You will see the name of the drug
                        programmer, if you click this then there will be a list of studies available to you. Select the
                        study and then Start analysis in the top right hand corner of the page. It is possible to select
                        more than one study at a time although they each have to belong to the same drug programme.
                        Selecting more than one study does not aggregate the study data merely displays the data from
                        studies in a single view.</p><br/>
                    <p><img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Try selecting a study.
                    <p><i> You will need to click next to the name of the dataset (and that can be more than one study
                        if available) and then the Start Analysis button in the top right hand corner to go to the
                        ACUITY analysis</i>.</p><br/>
                    <h4 id="population" class="anchor">POPULATION SUMMARY</h4>
                    <p>When an analysis loads (after selecting a dataset in the Study selection page) the first page the
                        user sees is the population summary bar chart. This provides a summary across all dosed patients
                        in the study. Both the x and y-axis can be changed by clicking the icon next to the title of the
                        axis and the filters can be used to filter the subjects shown
                        (see <a routerLink="/manual" fragment="population_filters" (click)="onAnchorClick()">population filter</a>.)</p><br/>
                    <h4 id="incontext" class="anchor">IN CONTEXT HELP</h4>
                    <p>In context help is available by clicking the in the top right hand corner. This will walk you
                        through some of the main features of ACUITY by an interactive pop up on the screen. This can be
                        useful to bring to your attention the main features of ACUITY. <br/>
                        <img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Click on the help icon and look at what it provides.</p><br/>
                    <h4 id="axis" class="anchor">AXIS TOOLS</h4>
                    <p>Most axes in ACUITY can be changed from the default values shown by clicking the icon next to the
                        axis title. The different plots have different options available and it is worth exploring the
                        individual plots for more details, <br/><img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Try
                        changing the y-axis to percentage of all subjects from count of subjects. <br/>
                        <img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Also try changing the x-axis.</p><br/>
                    <h4 id="colour" class="anchor">COLOUR BY TOOLS</h4>
                    <p>In many plots there is the option to change the Colour By option of the bars or lines e.g. In the
                        population summary you can show the bars coloured by country, by actual treatment arm, by sex
                        etc. This is done by clicking the paint drop icon located in the top right hand corner of the
                        plot where available. If the paint icon is not present then it is not possible to change the
                        colour of the plots at this time.<br/><img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Try
                        changing the Colour By in the population summary plot to Age.</p><br/>
                    <h4 id="population_filters" class="anchor">POPULATION FILTERS</h4>
                    <p>On every plot there are population filters. These enable the user to restrict the subjects that
                        are shown in the plot, for example to a specific treatment arm (where available) or to a
                        particular age cohort etc. To do this click either the icon to the right of the screen for
                        population filters or an alternative way is if you would like to select subjects from a given
                        plot you are looking at you can select them with your mouse and then when given the opiton
                        select 'set as population'. This applies the population filter of subject and limits to only
                        those subjects included in the selection. When a population filter has been applied the widget
                        bar at the top will show the applied filters and what they have been set to. <br/>
                        <img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Try filtering the data, for example click
                        sex and uncheck m.</p><br/>

                        tell you the total number of subjects and now, if a filter has been applied, how many subjects
                        are actually shown in the plot. Sometimes, for example if a number of subjects have been
                        filtered, the widget bar will tell you a filter has been applied but not the details. To get the

                    <h4 id="view" class="anchor">VIEW SELECTION</h4>
                    <p>There are many different views of the data available in ACUITY. The views that are available for
                        you on your study will depend on whether that data has been made available to ACUITY and whether
                        you have permission to see that data. To see what views are available, hover over the bar with
                        the icons to the left of your screen.<br/>As you hover the full name of the set of views will be
                        displayed. Within some views e.g. Adverse events, Laboratory measurements and single subject
                        there are multiple ways to look at the data and these appear as tabs acros the top of the view,
                        clicking a tab will show each plot. <br/>
                    <h5 id="adverse" class="anchor">ADVERSE EVENT VIEW</h5>
                    <p>This next section is looking at one particular view in ACUITY to get you familiar with the axis
                        controls and tabs, try doing the tasks below.

                        other view) try changing the axis or the Colour by options where available. <br/>
                    <img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Also have a look at the different tabs
                        (where available) at the top of the page, these are the different views of the same data. The
                        data can also be viewed in table format.</p><br/>
                    <h5 id="event" class="anchor">EVENT FILTERING</h5>
                    <p>In any of the views of the data, other than the Population Summary, an additional filter: the
                        event filters are available to the right hand side of the screen. The content of this filter
                        will change depending on the view you are looking at. For example, if you are in the Adverse
                        Event view, the content will be around Adverse Events, if you are in a Labs view it will be
                        about Lab Events and so on. <br/>
                        <img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Go to Adverse Events as an example. Here we can look at the event filter.<br/>
                        As an example we will filter based on Preferred Term and select headache. <br/>

                    <p>What will happen is the plot(s) will reload to show just the bars that matched your search and at
                        the top, under the Population bars there is now an Adverse Event widget bar with details of the
                        filter that has been applied and the total number of events that match that filter.</p><br/>
                    <h4 id="the_timeline" class="anchor">THE TIMELINE CHART</h4>
                    <p>A key view in ACUITY is the Timeline View, this brings together many different types of
                        data/events and aligns them on a single time axis making it possible to see where different
                        events occure relative to one another. It is available by clicking the icon in the panel to the
                        left or alternatively within a different view if events or subjects are selected there will be
                        the option to <i> View on timeline</i>. This will take you directly to the timeline view with
                        only the selected subjects shown and the relavant tracks. A track is a row of data. So for
                        example if you select subjects in the adverse event view and select <i>View on timeline</i> then
                        the timeline will load for only the selected patient and the rows shown will be the adverse
                        events for those subjects.</p><br/>
                    <p>Unless there are population filters set by default, all subjects will be shown in this view,
                        although for performance of the system only 20 are shown at a time. The next 20 subjects will be
                        available on page 2 and so on. Unless you have got to this view via the interactivity section
                        (described above) the default view is the Status summary for each subject. This tells us how
                        long each subject has been on the study, when they were screened, randomised, received their
                        first investigational product etc. (where that information is available for the dataset.)</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>This view is very interactive and it is possible to show different amounts of detail. The next
                        few sections describe this in more detail, the key is to right click on a track and/or use the
                        timeline settings which is with the filters to the right of the screen.<br/>
                    <h5 id="adding" class="anchor">ADDING TIMELINE TRACKS</h5>
                    <p>Each row in the Timeline view is called a track. Tracks can be added and removed from this view
                        using the filter panel to the right.<br/><img src="/assets/images/task.png"> The
                        first step is to add tracks to the data using the new Track icon in the filters to the right.
                        <br/>This gives you the option to add different datatypes.<br/>
                        <img src="/assets/images/task.png"> In this example we will add (where available) Adverse Events and Lab measurements.<br/>
                        The plot will refresh with the new tracks, which are added at a summary level (i.e. a single track per datatype).</p>
                    <p>The next section will discuss drilling down on each track, so showing more detailed information
                        rather than just a summary.<br/><br/>
                    <h5 id="drilling" class="anchor">DRILLING DOWN ON THE TIMELINE CHART</h5>
                    <p>With each track added at the summary level the next step is to drill down to more detailed
                        information. This can be done by right clicking on a particular track and selecting Expand. Note
                        that for some data types it is possible to drill down more than once, for example for laboratory
                        measurements a summary level which is a single track for all lab measurements on a given day.
                        The next level is laboratory category (e.g. chemistry, hematology etc.) with a single track for
                        each category covering all measurements on a given day. The next level is a single track for
                        each laboratory measurement provided as a symbol (squares for measurements within reference
                        ranges and triangles for measurements above and below the reference rages). The final level is a
                        track per laboratory measurement shown as a line chart over time.<br/>
                    <p>When you right click a track there will be a number of options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expand: this drills down to the next level of detail for this data type and subject only
                        </li>
                        <li>Expand all adverse event tracks: this drills down to the next level of detail for this data
                            type across all subjects.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There is a legend associated with the timeline track, you will need to close the filters to see
                        the legend </p><br/>

                    <p>Events in the Timeline View can be filtered in the same way as they can be in other plots. The
                        main difference here is that different event filters are added as tracks are added. So for
                        instance if the Adverse Event track is added then Adverse Event filters get added to the event
                        filter.<br/><img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Try filtering some events and see

                    <p>Single Subject views of the data are available by clicking the icon in the panel to the left.
                        There are a number of tabs that provide very detailed information about a single patient. If a
                        single patient has not already been selected then start typing the patient identifier into the
                        search box at the top of the page, it will auto-complete meaning it will provide a dropdown of
                        all the subjects matching your search criteria for you to select from.There are a number of tabs

                    <p>A key piece of functionality in ACUITY is the available to link between views.
                        This enables us to select points of interest on one view and look at only those subjects on other views, including
                        the Timeline View.<br/><img src="/assets/images/task.png"> To have a look at this
                        we will go back to the laboratory measurement view and remove all filters from the two panels at
                        the top (by clicking the icon next to all filters).<br/><img src="/assets/images/task.png"> Here we would like to
                        select some outliers. All the available lab measurements are shown over a number of pages. You
                        may need to go through the different pages to find a plot with some outliers.
                    <p>When you have selected some points on a chart (or double click a chart to select all data points)
                        then you will be given 4 different options:</p>
                    <ul>

                        </li>
                        <li><b>Option 2</b> is to set as population. This will apply the filter to limit to only those
                            subject ids that you have selected. The filter will appear in the population banner at the
                            top of the screen. All views will then only show data for those selected subjects.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Option 3</b> is to View on timeline. This will set the population and take you to the
                            Timeline View to show you the relevant data track. So for instance if you select a bar in
                            the Adverse Events view and select View on Timeline. The Timeline View will then show you
                            the Adverse Event tracks (at the level of preferred term) for the selected subjects.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Option 4</b> is Clear marking. As suggested this will clear the marking and close the
                            dialog box.<br/>

                    <p>1. To get to this answer we select ‘Demo’ on the study selection (Analytics) page
                        and the dataset ‘example_study’.<br/>
                        2. Next look at the view Adverse Events-&gt;AEs subject counts chart<br/>
                        3. Using the Event filter we can set Preferred term to &lsquo;headache&rsquo;<br/>
                        4. We can select the 16 subjects select to View on timeline option.<br/>
                        5. The banners at the top should now show 16 subjects under population and the
                        Timeline events filter set to Preferred Term: =Headache.<br/>
                        6. Next add the conmeds track to the timeline chart<br/>
                        7. Use the filters to add the conmed medication filter ‘paracetamol’ (and all variations thereof)<br/>
                        8. If you hover over each paracetamol event it will tell
                        you, where available, the indication the paracetamol was given for.<br/>
                        9. For this study the indication is not provided but of the 16 subjects 5 received paracetamol
                        during a headache event.</p><br/>

                        EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO OBSERVING A GREATER THAN 800% CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (AST)?</h5>
                    <p>1. To get to this answer we select ‘Demo ’ on the study selection (Analytics) page
                        and the ‘example_study’ dataset.<br/>
                        2. Next look at the view
                        Labs-&gt;Box Plots chart<br/>
                        3. Show only the measurement ‘Aspartate Aminotransferase’.<br/>
                        4. Make sure the y-axis is set to Percentage change from
                        baseline<br/>
                        5. Select the 3 points that are above the 800% line, these are from 3 different subjects,
                        and choose View in timeline<br/>
                        6. The Labs->Aspartate Aminotransferase track will be shown, drill down a level to see a line chart
                        of the measurements. In the commands to the right, under ‘Configuration’, change the labs y-axis
                        to ‘% change from baseline’.<br/>
                        7. Now add the dose track and drill down one level.<br/>
                        8. If you count the number of doses before AST increases by over 800% from baseline there are
                        2 for the first subject 0 for the second and 1 dose for the third.</p><br/>
                    <h5 id="question3" class="anchor">QUESTION 3: WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EVENT IN SUBJECTS UNDER
                        55 AND HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO SUBJECTS OVER 55?
                    </h5>
                    <p>1. To get to this answer we select ‘Demo’ on the study selection (Analytics) page
                        and the dataset ‘example_study’.<br/>
                        2. Next look at the view
                        Adverse Events-&gt;AEs subject counts chart<br/>
                        3. There are 2 ways to get this result the first
                        uses the population filters and the second the Population summary plot.<br/>
                        4. To use the population filters move the upper Age zoom to 55 and the plot will reload. Diarrhoea
                        is the most common AE. The same can be done for the age range greater than 55 and here Alopecia
                        is the most common adverse event.<br/>
                        5. An alternative is to use the Population Summary view. Make sure all filters are
                        clear (click the small cross next to any filters in the banners at the top of the page). <br/>
                        6. In Population summary set the x-axis to age, set the colour to actual study arm.<br/>
                        7. With the mouse select all the bars in the age categories for 55 and below and select Set as
                        Population.<br/>
                        8. If you go to the Adverse event view you can see for these subjects that the most frequently
                        reported preferred term is diarrohea.<br/>
                        9. If you clear the subjects filter and return to the Population summary plot you can select all
                        subjects greater than 55 and repeat to find Alopecia is the most commonly reported adverse event. </p><br/>
