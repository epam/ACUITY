### About  
  
#### About us  

`r params$about_us`.    


We would be grateful for feedback as to utility of this tool â€“ if you have any feedback, or you would like to know more detail about this tool, please contact `r params$contact_email`.  

#### What does this tool do?  
  
The digital ECMT cancer trial matching tool is intended to support clinicians in the matching of people with cancer to clinical trials based on their cancer type, genetic alterations and/or trial drug mechanism. This is an early version that could possibly change.  
  
  
Potential matching trials are ranked according to the following order:   
  
  
1.	Study is enrolling patients with specified genetic alterations, AND specified gene is targeted by a study drug.  

2.	Study is enrolling patients with specified genetic alterations, AND a study drug targets a gene immediately downstream.  

3.	Study is enrolling patients with specified genetic alterations.  

4.	Study drug targets gene of interest.  

5.	Study drug targets a gene immediately downstream of specified genetic alteration.  

6.	Match on cancer type alone.  
  
  
#### Data sources  
  
Trial data are sourced exclusively from clinicaltrials.gov via the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (https://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/ ).   

Data regarding mechanisms of trial interventions are sourced from the NCI Thesaurus: https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/  

Data regarding biological pathways are sourced from KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/) using the R BioConductor package: https://www.bioconductor.org/  
  
#### Limitations  
  
**Please note that it is not a comprehensive source of information about clinical trials, and its utility not been validated for use in clinical decision making.**  

Trials that are not included in clinicaltrials.gov will not be included in the search.  
  
  
Only studies with at least one site in `r params$country` are included. If you are interested in hosting a site for other countries, please contact `r params$contact_email`.  
  
Data are refreshed daily, but clinicians are advised to contact the relevant investigators to confirm recruitment status.  

Study eligibility criteria are tagged with the relevant genetic alterations based on natural language processing â€“ some criteria may be incorrectly tagged, and some relevant criteria may be missed.
